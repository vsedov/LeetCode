0 or 2 nodes as childreren

value of each non lead node is equal to th eproduct of the largest leaf
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

# so we have to add the smalelst min , value from those two points
# when you are building upwards , but you would have to make sure that the first
# point of the tree would be the same
