"""

    When you want a unique value , for each pointer within the list , we would use i -1 within range of i
    If we want the next two given values , or the two given substring , we would take those values instead . 

    than what you would get is teh following , you would get all possible optionsiwthin teh next values from 1 2 2 3 and so on 
    if you did i - 2 : i 

    , which is kinda cool , while x - 1 : i will only give 2 to the given length, the other one will not , which i found rather interesting 

    what you would end up having is a list of indomation that would be get updated overtime , or where you would add teh values onto each other , for how ever many pointers you have
